How many simulations and what type of simulations did they get and how did that impact their learning?\u201d Aebersold said. \u201cWe hit students with a lot of simulations while they\u2019re in school, but we don\u2019t necessarily know which ones are better for certain things.\u201d\nNow, as MIDAS core faculty member, Aebersold will be able to easily collaborate with other MIDAS researchers to refine and analyze her data.\nEventually, she said, she\u2019d like to be able to track nursing students as they enter their first jobs to see how their training translates to real-world performance. And a further goal for Aebersold is to help the practice of nursing education become similar to the training world-class athletes receive, in which, for example, subjects review videos of their performance to identify what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to introduce some things, like what can we do with virtual simulations, or what can we do with eye-tracking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really want to try to dive deeper, by being able to put all this information together using a lot of these data science methods.\u201d\nAebersold has been at U-M since the mid-1980s, serving in a variety of clinical and administrative roles. She earned a Ph.D in Nursing from the University in 2008, and served as Director of the Clinical Learning Center in the School of Nursing for eight years thereafter. Since 2016, she\u2019s been Director of Simulation and Educational Innovation.\nOne of Aebersold\u2019s recent projects, \u201cClosing the Loop: New Data Tools for measuring Changes in the Quality of Nursing Education,\u201d applies modern data-science tools to help understand the correlation between traditional tests and student skills and competence when they enter the workforce, and whether simulations coupled with debriefing sessions translate into improvements in skills and in test outcomes.\nAnother potential project will focus on comparing the eye movements of novice nurses to expert nurses. Aebersold said initial findings have shown that nurses with more experience tend to focus their eyes on one thing for longer periods of time than those with less.\nShe said she\u2019s enlisting help on that work from professors in the School of Information at U-M.\n\u201cBy really understanding the difference between how experts do things and novices do things, you can help develop simulations that help novices get better,\u201d Aebersold said.\nShe credits her father with starting her on the path to becoming a nurse; he was a police officer, and would sometimes take her to the local emergency room. \n\u201cI loved the fast pace,\u201d she recalled, and the chance to have a real, positive impact on people\u2019s lives. \nAfter earning a nursing degree from Madonna University, she became a critical care nurse. She then gravitated toward supervision and administration, gaining a masters in business administration, also from Madonna University. She earned her Ph.D. from U-M while working as a nurse manager at the U-M health System.\nShe said all the technology, data, and innovative modes of study she\u2019s brought together are all in service of one goal.\n\u201cFor me, it all comes down to how can we make the patient care environment safer for our patients,\u201d she said.\n", "email": "mabersol@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 615-8498", "per_web": "http://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/michelle-l-aebersold"}, "Mahesh Agarwal": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/mahesh-agarwal/", "brief_desc": "Number theory, geometry., polynomials", "title": "Associate Professor", "first_aff": "Literature, Science,and the Arts", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "Prof. Agarwal\u2019s is primarily interested in number theory, in particular in p-adic L-functions, Bloch-Kato conjecture and automorphic forms.

He is particularly interested in methods for causal inference using longitudinal data sets in which treatments, covariates, and outcomes are all time-varying. He is also interested in developing statistical methods that can be used to form adaptive interventions, sometimes known as dynamic treatment regimes. An adaptive intervention is a sequence of individually tailored decisions rules that specify whether, how, and when to alter the intensity, type, or delivery of treatment at critical decision points in the medical care process. Adaptive interventions are particularly well-suited for the management of chronic diseases, but can be used in any clinical setting in which sequential medical decision making is essential for the welfare of the patient. They hold the promise of enhancing clinical practice by flexibly tailoring treatments to patients when they need it most, and in the most appropriate dose, thereby improving the efficacy and effectiveness of treatment.\nStudy Design Interests: In addition to developing new statistical methodologies, Prof. Almirall devotes a portion of his research to the design of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs).

Chen\u2019s research expertise and interests are to integrate the physics-based computational and experimental methods and data-driven approaches, to exploit the fundamental phenomena emerged in advanced manufacturing and to establish the design protocol for optimizing the materials and process parameters of as-fabricated parts for quality control. Current research can be summarized by:\n1 One of significant challenges in additive manufacturing (AM) is the presence of heterogeneous sources of uncertainty involved in the complex layer-wise processes under non-equilibrium conditions that lead to variability in the microstructure and properties of as-built components. Consequently, it is extremely challenging to repeat the manufacturing of a high-quality product in mass production, and current practice usually reverts to trial-and-error techniques that are very time-consuming and costly. This research aims to develop an uncertainty quantification framework by bringing together physical modeling, machine-learning (ML), and experiments.\n2 Computational microstructure optimization of piezocomposites involves iterative searches to achieve the desired combination of properties demanded by a selected application. Traditional analytical-based optimization methods suffer from the searching efficiency and result optimality due to high dimensionality of microstructure space, complicated electrical and mechanical coupling and non-uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, AM process inherently poses several manufacturing constraints e.g., the minimum feature size and the porosity in the piezoelectric ceramics as well as at the ceramics-polymer interface. It is challenging to include such manufacturing constraints since they are not explicitly available. This research aims to develop a novel data-driven framework for microstructure optimization of AM piezoelectric composites by leveraging extensive physics-based simulation data as well as limited amount of measurement data from AM process.\n3 Lithium (Li) and other alkali metals (e.g., sodium and potassium) are very attractive electrode candidates for the next-generation rechargeable batteries that promise several times higher energy density at lower cost. However, Li-dendrite formation severely limits the commercialization of Li-metal batteries, either because dendrite pieces lose electrical contact with the rest of the Li-electrode or because growing dendrites can penetrate the separator and lead to short circuits. This research aims to develop a computational model to accelerate the design of dendrite-free Li-metal batteries.\nBlueprint for the research: data-driven modelling of additive manufacturing. Stereolithography-based and laser melting-based additive manufacturing processes are used to fabricate the powder-based piezoelectric ceramics and metals respectively, with controllable complex microstructures and/or architectures to tune material properties. Physics-based numerical simulations are performed in an \u201cin-house\u201d multiscale computational framework, which includes macroscopic finite-element based manufacturing process modelling, mesoscopic phase-field modelling of microstructure evolution and design, and first principles/CALPHAD calculation of thermodynamics and kinetics. Data-driven approaches include machine learning and uncertainty quantification with surrogate models, such as polynomial chaos expansion, Gaussian process, radial basis functions, etc.\n", "email": "leichn@umich.edu", "phone": "313-593-5122", "per_web": "https://umdearborn.edu/users/leichn"}, "Yi-Su Chen": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/yi-su-chen/", "brief_desc": "Supply chain security, product quality and safety", "title": "Assistant Professor", "first_aff": "Business", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "My current data science research interest lies in the broad area of supply chain and its management. \u00a0 I am particularly interested in using longitudinal data set to identify early signals (or warning) and to draw causal inferences pertaining to supply chain security and product quality and safety. \u00a0 I am also interested in developing experiments to capture the behavioral side of decision makings to be complementary to secondary data analysis. \u00a0 Industry setting wise, I have based my research on the auto industry, and will expand my auto-industry centered research into a broader, transportation industry oriented context. \u00a0 I am also interested in food and agricultural products, pharmaceutical, and medical devices industries where product quality and safety have significant implications to human life and society as a whole.\n", "email": "yisuchen@umich.edu", "phone": "(313)-583-6481", "per_web": "http://umdearborn.edu/cob/yi-su-chen/"}, "Vu-Minh Chieu": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/vu-minh-chieu/", "brief_desc": "Technology-enhanced personal learning", "title": "Assistant Research Scientist", "first_aff": "Education", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "Vu-Minh Chieu is an assistant research scientist at the GRIP (Geometry, Reasoning, and Instructional Practices) laboratory, directed by Patricio Herbst at the School of Education.

Dr. Flannagan has over 20 years of experience conducting data analysis and research on injury risk related to motor vehicle crashes and was responsible for the development of a model of injury outcome that allows side-by-side comparison of public health, vehicle, roadway and post-crash interventions (utmost.umtri.umich.edu). She has also applied statistical methods to understanding and evaluating benefits of crash-avoidance technologies, including evaluating safety in automated vehicles, and works to develop novel applications of statistics to analysis of driving data. Her current work with CMISST involves the fusion and analysis of large state-level crash databases, which are useful in analyzing the effect of a variety of countermeasures on crash involvement and injury risk. In addition, her group is working to make data available to researchers to expand the community of experts in transportation data analysis.\n\nQ & A with Dr. Carol Flannagan\nQ: \u00a0When in your career did you realize that data (broadly speaking) could open a lot of doors, in terms of research?\nI have loved data analysis since my undergraduate Experimental Design course sophomore year when I learned about analysis of 2X2 tables. Beyond that, I didn\u2019t necessarily see it as a career move or a research program. It was much later at UMTRI, when I started thinking about how much data we had scattered around the building and how great it would be to round up those data and share them, that I though explicitly about data per se as opening research doors.\nIn 2010, I was asked to head up the Transportation Data Center at UMTRI. In spite of its name, the group was doing very limited things with crash data at the time. After a few years, the group got a new name and some support to grow from UMOR. That, along with a number of research projects over the years, has led to our current incarnation with substantially upgraded data hosting for the state of Michigan\u2019s crash data and strong capabilities in data analysis of all kinds of newer transportation data. For example, we have collaborated with the Engineering Systems group, GM and OnStar to conduct a series of studies funded by NHTSA to analyze driver response to crash avoidance systems using OnStar data on a large scale.\nWith the MIDAS transportation project, we are moving forward on several fronts. Most importantly, we are developing a high-performance data access and processing system to handle the large driving datasets that UMTRI has collected (and continues to collect). This system can integrate automated video processing with analysis and/or querying of time series data (e.g., speed, acceleration, etc.). For my group, this new capability opens new doors in both data sharing and data analysis.\nQ: How has the field, and specifically the use of \u201cBig Data,\u201d changed during your career?\nWow\u2026 My first analyses as an undergrad were computed by hand as a matter of course. In grad school, since we needed to access terminals to use MTS (the Michigan Terminal System), it was often faster to just do it by hand (using a calculator and paper and pencil). What that meant is that computation was a true limitation on how much data could be analyzed. Even after personal computers were a regular fixture in research (and at home), computation of any size (e.g., more subjects or more variables) was still slow. My dissertation included a simulation component and I used to set simulations running every night before I went to bed. The simulation would finish around 2-3 a.m., and the computer would suddenly turn on, sending bright light into the room and waking my husband and me up. Those simulations can all be done in minutes or seconds now. Imagine how much more I could have done with current systems! \nIn the last 5 years, I\u2019ve gotten much more involved in analysis of driving data to understand benefits of crash avoidance systems. We are often searching these data for extracts that contain certain kinds of situations that are relevant to such systems (e.g., hard braking events related to forward collision warnings). This is one use of Big Data\u2014to observe enough that you can be sure of finding examples of what you\u2019re interested in. However, in the last year or two, I have been more involved in full-dataset analyses, large-scale triggered data collection, and large-scale kinematic simulations. These are all enabled by faster computing and because of that, we can find richer answers to more questions.\nQ: What role does your association with MIDAS play in this continuing development?\nOne of the advantages of being associated with MIDAS is that it gives me access to faculty who are interested in data as opposed to transportation. It\u2019s not that I need other topic areas, but I often find that when I listen to data and methods talks in totally different content areas, I can see how those methods could apply to problems I care about. For example, the challenge grant in the social sciences entitled \u201cComputational Approaches for the Construction of Novel Macroeconomic Data,\u201d is tackling a problem for economists that transportation researchers share. That is, how do you help researchers who may not have deep technical skill in data querying get at extracts from very large, complex datasets easily? Advances that they make in that project could be transferred to transportation datasets, which share many of the characteristics of social-media datasets.\nAnother advantage is the access to students who are in data-oriented programs (e.g., statistics, data science, computer science, information, etc.) who want real-world experiences using their skills. I have had a number of data science students reach out to me and worked closely with two of them on independent studies where we worked together on Big Data analysis problems in transportation. One was related to measuring and tracking vehicle safety in automated vehicles and the other was in text mining of a complaints dataset to try to find failure patterns that might indicate the presence of a vehicle defect.\nQ: What are the next research challenges for transportation generally and your work specifically?\nTransportation is in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime transformation. In my lifetime, I expect to be driven to the senior center and my gerontologist appointments by what amounts to a robot (on wheels). Right now, I\u2019m working on research problems that will help bring that to fruition. Data science is absolutely at the core of that transformation and the problems are wide open. I\u2019m particularly concerned that our research datasets need to be managed in a way that opens them to a broad audience where we support both less technical interactions (e.g., data extracts with a very simple querying system) and much more technical interactions (e.g., full-dataset automatic video processing to identify drivers using cell phones in face video). I\u2019m also interested in new and efficient large-scale data collection methods, particularly those based on the idea of \u201csmart\u201d or triggered sampling rather than just acquisition of huge datasets \u201cbecause the information I want is somewhere in there\u2026if only I can find it\u2026\u201d\nMy own work has mostly been about safety, and although we envision a future without traffic fatalities (or ideally without crashes), the current fatality count has gone up over the past couple of years. Thus, I spend time analyzing crash data for new insights into changes in safety over time and even how the economy influences fatality counts. Much of my work is for the State of Michigan around predicting how many fatalities there will be in the next few years and identifying the benefits and potential benefits of various interventions. My web tool, UTMOST, (the Unified Theory Mapping Opportunities for Safety Technologies) allows visualization of the benefits, or potential benefits, of many different kinds of interventions, including public health policy, vehicle technology, and infrastructure improvements. I think this kind of integrated approach will be necessary to achieve the goal of zero fatalities over the next 20 years. Finally, a significant part of my research program will continue to be development and use of statistical methods to measure, predict, and understand safety in transportation. How can we tell if AVs are safer than humans? What should future traffic safety data systems look like? How can we integrate data systems (e.g., crash and injury outcome) to better understand safety and figure out how to prioritize countermeasure development? How can machine learning and other big data statistical tools help us make the most of driving data?\n", "email": "cacf@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 936-1102", "per_web": "http://www.umtri.umich.edu/who-we-are/staff-directory/carol-flannagan"}, "Danny Forger": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/danny-forger/", "brief_desc": "Computer simulation and mathematical modeling of biological clocks", "title": "Professor", "first_aff": "Literature, Science,and the Arts", "second_aff": "Medicine", "long_desc": "Daniel Forger is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics.

More specifically, he is working with collaborators on developing methods that can be used when the data are corrupted by systematic measurement errors of unknown origin, or when the data suffer from the effects of unobserved confounders. For example, gene expression data suffer from both systematic measurement errors of unknown origin (due to uncontrolled variations in laboratory conditions) and the effects of unobserved confounders (such as whether a patient had just eaten before a tissue sample was taken). They are developing methodology that is able to correct for these systematic errors using \u201cnegative controls.\u201d Negative controls are variables that (1) are known to have no true association with the biological signal of interest, and (2) are corrupted by the systematic errors, just like the variables that are of interest.

Data science is the methodological underpinning for data collection, data management, data analysis, and data visualization. Lying at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and engineering, data science has a wide range of application in areas including: public health and personalized medicine, brain sciences, environmental and earth sciences, astronomy, materials science, genomics and proteomics, computational social science, business analytics, computational finance, information forensics, and national defense. The Hero group is developing theory and algorithms for data collection, analysis and visualization that use statistical machine learning and distributed optimization. These are being to applied to network data analysis, personalized health, multi-modality information fusion, data-driven physical simulation, materials science, dynamic social media, and database indexing and retrieval. Several thrusts are being pursued:\n\nDevelopment of tools to extract useful information from high dimensional datasets with many variables and few samples (large p small n). A major focus here is on the mathematics of \u201cbig data\u201d that can establish fundamental limits; aiding data analysts to \u201cright size\u201d their sample for reliable extraction of information. Areas of interest include: correlation mining in high dimension, i.e., inference of correlations between the behaviors of multiple agents from limited statistical samples, and dimensionality reduction, i.e., finding low dimensional projections of the data that preserve information in the data that is relevant to the analyst.\nData representation, analysis and fusion on non-linear non-euclidean structures. Examples of such data include: data that comes in the form of a probability distribution or histogram (lies on a hypersphere with the Hellinger metric); data that are defined on graphs or networks (combinatorial non-commutative structures); data on spheres with point symmetry group structure, e.g., quaternion representations of orientation or pose.\nResource constrained information-driven adaptive data collection. We are interested in sequential data collection strategies that utilize feedback to successively select among a number of available data sources in such a way to minimize energy, maximize information gains, or minimize delay to decision. A principal objective has been to develop good proxies for the reward or risk associated with collecting data for a particular task (detection, estimation, classification, tracking). We are developing strategies for model-free empirical estimation of surrogate measures including Fisher information, R'{e}nyi entropy, mutual information, and Kullback-Liebler divergence. In addition we are quantifying the loss of plan-ahead sensing performance due to use of such proxies.\n\nCorrelation mining pipeline transforms raw high dimensional data (bottom) to information that can be rendered in interpretable sparse graphs and networks, simple screeplots, and denoised images (top). The pipeline controls data collection, feature extraction and correlation mining by integrating domain information and its assessed value relative to the desired task (on left) and accounting for constraints on data collection budget and uncertainty bounds (on right).\n", "email": "hero@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 763-0564", "per_web": "https://hero.engin.umich.edu/"}}, "https://midas.umich.edu/affiliated-faculty/?wpv_view_count=29518-TCPID28544&lname=&wpv_post_search=&wpv_paged=7": {"Joseph Himle": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/joseph-himle/", "brief_desc": "Monitoring and treatment of trichotillomania", "title": "Professor", "first_aff": "Social Work", "second_aff": "Medicine", "long_desc": "Joseph A.

TTM is associated with significant impairments in social functioning and often has a profound negative impact on self-esteem and well being. Best practice treatment for TTM involves a form of behavioral therapy known as habit reversal therapy (HRT). HRT requires persons with trichotillomania to be aware of their hair pulling behaviors, yet the majority of persons with TTM pull most of their hair outside of their awareness . HRT also requires TTM sufferers to record the frequency and duration of their hair pulling behaviors yet it is obviously impossible for a person to monitor behaviors that they are unaware of. Our Phase I efforts have produced a prototype device (AEMD) that solves these two problems. The prototype AEMD signals the TTM sufferer if their hand approaches their hair, thereby bringing pulling-related behavior into awareness. The prototype AEMD also logs the time, date, duration, and user classification of hair pulling related events and can later transfer the logged data to a personal computer for analysis and data presentation. He continues to refine this device and seek to integrate it with smart-phones to better understand activities and locations associated with hair pulling or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., skin picking). In the future, he seeks to pool data from users to get a better sense of common situations and other factors associated with elevated pulling rates. He intends to develop other electronic tools to detect, monitor and intervene with other mental disorders in the future.\n", "email": "himlej@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 330-3258", "per_web": "https://ssw.umich.edu/faculty/profiles/tenure-track/himlej"}, "James R.

Within data mining, we focus particularly on interconnected or graph data, which are ubiquitous. Some examples include social networks, brain graphs or connectomes, traffic networks, computer networks, phonecall and email communication networks, and more. We leverage ideas from a diverse set of fields, including matrix algebra, graph theory, information theory, machine learning, optimization, statistics, databases, and social science.\nAt a high level, we enable single-source and multi-source data analysis by providing scalable methods for fusing data sources, relating and comparing them, and summarizing patterns in them. Our work has applications to exploration of scientific data (e.g., connectomics or brain graph analysis), anomaly detection, re-identification, and more. Some of our current research directions include:\n*Scalable Network Discovery from non-Network Data*: Although graphs are ubiquitous, they are not always directly observed. Discovering and analyzing networks from non-network data is a task with applications in fields as diverse as neuroscience, genomics, energy, economics, and more. However, traditional network discovery approaches are computationally expensive. We are currently investigating network discovery methods (especially from time series) that are both fast and accurate.\n*Graph similarity and Alignment with Representation Learning*: Graph similarity and alignment (or fusion) are core tasks for various data mining tasks, such as anomaly detection, classification, clustering, transfer learning, sense-making, de-identification, and more. We are exploring representation learning methods that can generalize across networks and can be used in such multi-source network settings.\n*Scalable Graph Summarization and Interactive Analytics*: Recent advances in computing resources have made processing enormous amounts of data possible, but the human ability to quickly identify patterns in such data has not scaled accordingly. Thus, computational methods for condensing and simplifying data are becoming an important part of the data-driven decision making process. We are investigating ways of summarizing data in a domain-specific way, as well as leveraging such methods to support interactive visual analytics.\n*Distributed Graph Methods*: Many mining tasks for large-scale graphs involve solving iterative equations efficiently. For example, classifying entities in a network setting with limited supervision, finding similar nodes, and evaluating the importance of a node in a graph, can all be expressed as linear systems that are solved iteratively. The need for faster methods due to the increase in the data that is generated has permeated all these applications, and many more. Our focus is on speeding up such methods for large-scale graphs both in sequential and distributed environments. \n*User Modeling*: The large amounts of online user information (e.g., in social networks, online market places, streaming music and video services) have made possible the analysis of user behavior over time at a very large scale. Analyzing the user behavior can lead to better understanding of the user needs, better recommendations by service providers that lead to customer retention and user satisfaction, as well as detection of outlying behaviors and events (e.g., malicious actions or significant life events).

Her most recent research activities involve sequential learning, modeling and mining of large scale Internet measurement data concerning cyber security, and incentive mechanisms for inter-dependent security games. Within this context, her research group is actively working on the following directions.\n1. Cyber security incident forecast. The goal is to predict an organization\u2019s likelihood of having a cyber security incident in the near future using a variety of externally collected Internet measurement data, some of which capture active maliciousness (e.g., spam and phishing/malware activities) while others capture more latent factors (e.g., misconfiguration and mismanagement). While machine learning techniques have been extensively used for detection in the cyber security literature, using them for prediction has rarely been done. This is the first study on the prediction of broad categories of security incidents on an organizational level. Our work to date shows that with the right choice of feature set, highly accurate predictions can be achieved with a forecasting window of 6-12 months. Given the increasing amount of high profile security incidents (Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, and Anthem, just to name a few) and the amount of social and economic cost they inflict, this work will have a major impact on cyber security risk management.\n2. Detect propagation in temporal data and its application to identifying phishing activities. Phishing activities propagate from one network to another in a highly regular fashion, a phenomenon known as fast-flux, though how the destination networks are chosen by the malicious campaign remains unknown. An interesting challenge arises as to whether one can use community detection methods to automatically extract those networks involved in a single phishing campaign; the ability to do so would be critical to forensic analysis. While there have been many results on detecting communities defined as subsets of relatively strongly connected entities, the phishing activity exhibits a unique propagating property that is better captured using an epidemic model. By using a combination of epidemic modeling and regression we can identify this type of propagating community with reasonable accuracy; we are working on alternative methods as well.\n3. Data-driven modeling of organizational and end-user security posture. We are working to build models that accurately capture the cyber security postures of end-users as well as organizations, using large quantities of Internet measurement data. One domain is on how software vendors disclose security vulnerabilities in their products, how they deploy software upgrades and patches, and in turn, how end users install these patches; all these elements combined lead to a better understanding of the overall state of vulnerability of a given machine and how that relates to user behaviors. Another domain concerns the interconnectedness of today\u2019s Internet which implies that what we see from one network is inevitably related to others. We use this connection to gain better insight into the conditions of not just a single network viewed in isolation, but multiple networks viewed together.\nA predictive analytics approach to forecasting cyber security incidents. We start from Internet-scale measurement on the security postures of network entities. We also collect security incident reports to use as labels in a supervised learning framework. The collected data then goes through extensive processing and domain-specific feature extraction. Features are then used to train a classifier that generates predictions when we input new features, on the likelihood of a future incident for the entity associated with the input features. We are also actively seeking to understand the causal relationship among different features and the security interdependence among different network entities. Lastly, risk prediction helps us design better incentive mechanisms which is another facet of our research in this domain.\n", "email": "mingyan@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 764-9546", "per_web": "https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/faculty/eecsfaculty.html?uniqname=mingyan"}, "Xuefeng (Chris) Liu": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/xuefeng-chris-liu/", "brief_desc": "Statistical models for critical issues", "title": "Associate Professor", "first_aff": "Nursing", "second_aff": "Public Policy", "long_desc": "Dr. Liu has a broad research interest in the development of statistical models and techniques to address critical issues in health and nursing sciences, computational processing of Big Data in clinical Informatics and Genomics, statistical modeling and assessment of risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, central obesity, smoking) for adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes and maternal and child health.

Data heterogeneity is common across many high-impact application domains, ranging from recommendation system to Computer Vision, Bioinformatics and Health-informatics.

The topics that I am particularly interested in are: magnetic flux emergence, magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation, propagation, and CME-driven shocks. Flux emergence was the topic of my Ph.D. thesis research, which demonstrated that the expansion of magnetic fields in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere naturally produces Lorentz forces that drive shear flows. These flows lead to the formation of highly energized coronal magnetic fields, which are observed to be at the epicenter of coronal eruptions. This work provides a fundamental explanation for shear flows, which for decades, have been prescribed as ad hoc boundary conditions in numerical models of CMEs, flares and filament eruptions. While at the University of Michigan, I have advanced this fundamental theory of CME initiation by simulating the eruption of both magnetic arcades and flux ropes by such self-induced shear flows. I conceived and implemented the Gibson-Low flux rope as a way of simulating coronal mass ejections and applied this model to study the the propagation of CMEs from the solar corona through the heliosphere. In doing so, many new aspects of CME interaction with the interplanetary medium were discovered. With coauthors, I demonstrated the model\u2019s capability to predict ICME disturbances at Earth, and advised my student, Meng Jin, in developing data-driven tool, EEGGL, which prescribe the model\u2019s parameters and is now installed at CCMC.

Historically, a single dose has been selected for a population of patients (e.g. all stage III NSC lung cancer). However, the availability of new biologic markers for toxicity and efficacy allow the possibility of selecting a more personalized dose. I am interested in using statistical models for toxicity and efficacy as a function of RT dose and biomarkers to select an optimal dose for an individual patient. We are studying quantitative methods based on utilities to make this efficacy/toxicity tradeoff explicit and quantitative when biomarkers for one or multiple outcomes are available. We have proposed a simulation based method for studying the likely effects of any model or marker based dose selection on both toxicity and efficacy outcomes for a population of patients. In related projects, we are studying the role of correlation between the sensitivity of a patient\u2019 tumor and normal tissues to radiation. We are also studying how to utilize these techniques in combination with baseline and/or mid-treatment adaptive image guided RT.\nEarly Phase Oncology Study Design \u2013 An increasingly common feature of phase I designs is the inclusion of 1 or more dose expansion cohorts (DECs) in which the MTD is first estimated using a 3+3 or other Phase I design and then a fixed number (often 10-20 in 1-10 cohorts) of patients are treated at the dose initially estimated to be the MTD. Such an approach has not been studied statistically or compared to alternative designs. We have shown that a CRM design, in which the dose-assignment mechanism is kept active for all patients, more accurately identifies the MTD and protects the safety of trial patients than a similarly sized DEC trial. It also meets the objective of treating 15 or more patients at the final estimated MTD.\u00a0 A follow-up paper evaluating the role of DECs with a focus on efficacy estimation is in press at Annals of Oncology.\n\n", "email": "mjschipp@umich.edu", "phone": "(269) 270-1334", "per_web": "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/schipper-matthew.html"}, "Patrick Schloss": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/patrick-schloss/", "brief_desc": "Beneficial and pathogenic host-microbiome interactions", "title": "Frederick G Novy Collegiate Professor of Microbiome Research", "first_aff": "Architecture & Urban Planning", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "The Schloss lab is broadly interested in beneficial and pathogenic host-microbiome interactions with the goal of improving our understanding of how the microbiome can be used to reach translational outcomes in the prevention, detection, and treatment of colorectal cancer, Crohn\u2019s disease, and Clostridium difficile infection. To address these questions, we test traditional ecological theory in the microbial context using a systems biology approach. Specifically, the laboratory specializes in using studies involving human subjects and animal models to understand how biological diversity affects community function using a variety of culture-independent genomics techniques including sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. In addition, they use metabolomics to understand the functional role of the gut microbiota in states of health and disease. To support these efforts, they develop and apply bioinformatic tools to facilitate their analysis. Most notable is the development of the mothur software package (https://www.mothur.org), which is one of the most widely used tools for analyzing microbiome data and has been cited more than 7,300 times since it was initially published in 2009. The Schloss lab deftly merges the ability to collect data to answer important biological questions using cutting edge wet-lab techniques and computational tools to synthesize these data to answer their biological questions.\nGiven the explosion in microbiome research over the past 15 years, the Schloss lab has also stood at the center of a major effort to train interdisciplinary scientists in applying computational tools to study complex biological systems. These efforts have centered around developing reproducible research skills and applying modern data visualization techniques. An outgrowth of these efforts at the University of Michigan has been the institutionalization of The Carpentries organization on campus (https://carpentries.org), which specializes in peer-to-peer instruction of programming tools and techniques to foster better reproducibility and build a community of practitioners.\nThe Schloss lab uses computational tools to integrate multi-omics tools in a culture-independent approach to understand how bacteria interact with each other and their host to drive processes such as colorectal cancer and susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infections.\n", "email": "pschloss@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 647-5801", "per_web": "http://www.schlosslab.org/"}, "Santiago Schnell": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/santiago-schnell/", "brief_desc": "Mathematical, computational and statistical methods for optimal experimental design", "title": "Professor", "first_aff": "Medicine", "second_aff": "Medicine", "long_desc": "Dr. Schnell works at the interface between biophysical chemistry, mathematical and computational biology, and pathophysiology.

Reproducibility is central to scientific credibility. Meta-research has repeatedly shown that accurate reporting and sound peer-review do not by themselves guarantee the reproducibility of scientific results. One of the leading causes of poor reproducibility is limited research efforts in quantitative biology and chemometrics. In my laboratory, we are developing new ways to assess the reproducibility of quantitative findings in the biochemical sciences.\nAs a team scientist, Dr. Schnell\u2019s research interest is to investigate complex biomedical systems comprising many interacting components, where modeling and theory may aid in the identification of the key mechanisms underlying the behavior of the system as a whole. His collaborators are primarily basic scientists who focus on the identification of molecular, biochemical or developmental mechanisms associated with diseases. To this end, Dr. Schnell\u2019s expertise plays a central role in the identification of these mechanisms. Using mathematical and computational models, Dr. Schnell can formulate several hypothetical model mechanisms in parallel, which are compared with independent experimental data used to construct the models. The resulting comparisons are then independent between models, and any models that satisfy statistical measures of similarity will be used to make predictions, which will be tested experimentally by his collaborators. The model validated by the experiments will be considered the mechanism capable of explaining the behavior of the systems.\n\n", "email": "schnells@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 615-8733", "per_web": "http://www.med.umich.edu/schnell-lab"}, "Sarita Schoenebeck": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/sarita-schoenebeck/", "brief_desc": "", "title": "Associate Professor", "first_aff": "Information", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "My work lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, social computing, social media.

Incorporating millions of new energy devices will require wide-ranging transformation of the nation\u2019s aging electrical grid infrastructure. The key challenge is to efficiently manage a great amount of devices through distributed intelligence. The distributed grid intelligence (DGI) agent is the brain of distributed energy devices. DGI enables every single energy device to not only have a certain intelligence to achieve optimal management locally, but also coordinate with others to achieve a common goal. The massive volume of real-time data collected by DGI will help the grid operators gain a better understanding of a large-scale and highly dynamic power systems. In conventional power systems, the system operation is performed using purely centralized data storage and processing approaches. However, as the number of DGIs increases to more than hundreds of thousands, it is rather intuitive that the state-of-the-art centralized information processing architecture will no longer be sustainable under such big data explosion. The ongoing research work illustrates how advanced ideas from IT industry and power industry can be combined in a unique way. The proposed high-availability distributed file system and data processing framework can be easily tailored to support other data-intensive applications in a large-scale and complex power grids. For example, the proposed DGI nodes can be embedded into any distributed generators (e.g., roof-top PV panel), distributed energy storage devices (e.g., electric vehicle), and loads (e.g., smart home) in a future residential distribution system. If implemented successfully, we can translate Smart Grid with high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data to a completely distributed cyber-physical system architecture.

This modeling strategy enables data integration from measurements collected from sources that might not be completely homogeneous.

Dr. Wu\u2019s research focuses on the design and application of statistical methods that inform health decisions made by individuals, or precision medicine. The original methods and software developed by Dr. Wu are now used by investigators from research institutes such as CDC and Johns Hopkins, as well as site investigators from developing countries, e.g., Kenya, South Africa, Gambia, Mali, Zambia, Thailand and Bangladesh.\n\u00a0\nProfile: At a \u201csweet spot\u201d of data science\n\nBy Dan Meisler\n Communications Manager, ARC\nIf you had to name two of the more exciting, emerging fields of data science, electronic health records (EHR) and mobile health might be near the top of the list.\nZhenke Wu, one of the newest MIDAS core faculty members, has one foot firmly in each field.\n\u201cThese two fields share the common goal of learning from the experience of the population in the past to advance health and clinical decisions for those to follow. I am looking forward to more work that will bring the two fields closer to continuously generate insights about human health.\u201d Wu said. \u201cI\u2019m in a sweet spot.\u201d\nWu joined U-M in Fall 2016, after earning a PhD in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University, and a bachelor\u2019s in Mathematics from Fudan University. He said the multitude of large-scale studies going on at U-M and access to EHR databases were factors in his coming to Michigan.\n\u201cThe University of Michigan is an exciting place that has a diversity of large-scale databases and supportive research groups in the fields I\u2019m interested in,\u201d he said.\nWu is collaborating with the Michigan Genomics Initiative, which is a biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine to integrate genome-wide information with EHR from approximately 40,000 patients undergoing anesthesia prior to surgery or diagnostic procedures. He\u2019s also collaborating with Dr. Srijan Sen, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, on the MIDAS-supported project \u201cIdentifying Real-Time Data Predictors of Stress and Depression Using Mobile Technology,\u201d the preliminary results of which recently matured into an NIH-funded R01 project \u201cMobile Technology to Identify Mechanisms Linking Genetic Variation and Depression\u201d that will draw broad expertise from a multi-disciplinary team of medical and data science researchers.\nA visualization of data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative\n\u201cOne of my goals is to use an integrated and rigorous approach to predict how a person\u2019s health status will be in the near future,\u201d Wu said.\nWu applies hierarchical Bayesian models to these problems, which he hopes will shed light on phenomena he describes as latent constructs that are \u201cwell-known, but less quantitatively understood, e.g., intelligence quotient (IQ) in psychology.\u201d \nAs another example, he cites the current challenge in active surveillance of prostate cancer patients for aggressive tumors requiring removal and/or radiation, or indolent tumors permitting continued surveillance.\n\u201cThe underlying status of aggressive versus indolent cancer is not observed, which needs to be learned from the results of biopsy and other clinical measurements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decisions and experience of urologists and their patients will greatly benefit from more accurate understanding of the tumor status\u2026 There are lots of scientific problems in clinical, biomedical, behavioral and social sciences where you have well-known but less quantitatively understood latent constructs. These are problems that Bayesian latent variable methods can formulate and address.\u201d\nJust as Wu has a hand in two hot-button big data areas, he also sees himself as straddling the line between application and methodology. \nHe says the large number of data sources \u2014 sensors, mobile apps, test results, and questionnaires, to name just a few \u2014 results in richness as well as some \u201cmessiness\u201d that needs new methodologies to adjust, integrate and translate to new scientific insights. At the same time, a valid new methodology for dealing with, for example, electronic health data, will likely find numerous different applications.\nWu says his approach was heavily influenced by his work in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) funded by the Gates Foundation while he was at Johns Hopkins. Pneumonia is a clinical syndrome due to lung infection that can be caused by more than 30 different species of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The goal of the seven-country study that enrolled more than 5,000 cases and 5,000 controls from Africa and Southeast Asia is to estimate the frequency with which each pathogen caused pneumonia in the population and the probability of each individual being infected by the list of pathogens in the lung. \n\u201cIn most settings, it is extremely difficult to identify the pathogen by directly sampling from the site of infection \u2013 the child\u2019s lung. PERCH therefore looked for other sources of evidence by standardizing and comprehensively testing biofluids collected from sites peripheral to the lung. Using hierarchical Bayesian models to infer disease etiology by integrating such a large trove of data was extremely fun and exciting\u201d, he said.\nWu\u2019s initial interest in math, leading to biostatistics and now data science, stems from what he called a \u201cgreedy\u201d desire to learn the guiding principles of how the world works by rigorous data science.\n\u201cIf you have new problems, you can wait for other people to ask a clean math question, or you can go work with these messy problems and figure out interesting questions and their answers,\u201d he said.\nFor more on Dr. Wu, see his profile on Michigan Experts.\nRecent publications\nFrom experts.umich.edu.\n[feedzy-rss feeds=\u201dhttps://experts.umich.edu/en/persons/zhenke-wu/publications/?format=rss\u201d max=\u201d3\u2033 feed_title=\u201dno\u201d refresh=\u201d12_hours\u201d sort=\u201ddate_desc\u201d meta=\u201dyes\u201d summary=\u201dyes\u201d ]\n", "email": "zhenkewu@umich.edu", "phone": "(734) 764-7067", "per_web": "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/wu-zhenke.html"}, "Gongjun Xu": {"page": "https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/gongjun-xu/", "brief_desc": "latent variable models, psychometrics, statistics", "title": "Assistant Professor", "first_aff": "", "second_aff": "", "long_desc": "Dr. Gongjun Xu is an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan.
